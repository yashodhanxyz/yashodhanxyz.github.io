Our team at Order touches freight forwarders, warehouse managers, and CX leads. Their contexts vary wildly, but the
system we were building had to serve them all. We installed a feedback loop that shipped every week without turning
into an academic exercise.

## Capture what happened, not what you feel

Everyone shadowing a customer uses the same lightweight template: timestamp, situation, action, outcome. No opinions,
just observable facts. That clarity makes synthesis faster later.

## Tag once, stay organized forever

Signal Kit, a small internal tool, auto-tags highlights by intent areas we care about&mdash;automation anxiety, partner
trust, exception workflows. Humans can tweak, but the suggestions keep us honest about clustering observations by
problem, not feature requests.

## Digest together, decide together

Every Monday we send a 5-minute digest that links the raw clips, the tags applied, and the decisions we made. Ops
leaders can skim the headline and know exactly where to dig deeper.

This loop keeps the roadmap tethered to reality. No big research drops, no stale decksâ€”just a drumbeat that turns
customer conversations into product moves.

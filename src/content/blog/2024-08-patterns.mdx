When we stood up Order’s orchestration engine, the toughest part wasn’t writing code&mdash;it was agreeing on the
defaults that would meet operators where their work happens. Good defaults act like scaffolding: they make the
right path feel obvious without boxing in the experts who know when to diverge.

## Listen before automating

We shadowed fulfillment teams across three regions and wrote down every manual decision they made. Patterns emerged:
"expedite when SKU category equals perishable", "always double-confirm orders with a cold-chain leg", "flag partner
carriers whose reliability has dipped this week". Only after mapping these checkpoints did we start encoding them.

  Defaults should speed up a confident yes, not silence a critical no.
</Callout>

## Encode defaults as explainable blocks

Rather than bury logic in code, we exposed the defaults as a block library inside the workflow composer. Operators
could drag a guardrail into a flow, tweak thresholds, and see instantly how it cascaded.

We also built simulation tooling so any tweak could be run against historic shipments before going live. Operators
saw the expected impact, got alerted to outliers, and still had a big red button to intervene.

## Publish how defaults evolve

The defaults were never set-and-forget. Every Friday a short digest summarized what changed, who changed it, and why.
We piped that straight into the ops team’s planning doc so everyone stayed aligned.

The payoff? Fulfillment teams stopped babysitting dashboards and started coaching. Automation ran calmly in the
background because the defaults carried their intent forward.

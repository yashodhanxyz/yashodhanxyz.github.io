When we kicked off The Legal Chronicles, legal experts were sitting on goldâ€”case analysis, regulatory updates,
interviews with compliance leads. But packaging that knowledge into a format humans would read was the challenge.

## Start with the publishing supply chain

We mapped every step from expert interview to final approve: research, drafting, legal review, editing, design, QA,
launch. Understanding the hand-offs showed us where context was getting lost and where reviewers were waiting on
information that arrived too late.

  If a reviewer signs off without context for why a piece matters, they will block it next time.

## Encode the voice in components

We built a modular component library inside our CMS&mdash;analysis blocks, interview callouts, narrative timelines.
Writers could remix segments freely while design stayed consistent. Legal reviewers saw lightweight checklists that
matched each component, so approvals focused on substance, not formatting.

## Measure for trust, not clicks

Engagement mattered, but we prioritized trust signals first: reviewer satisfaction, the share rate inside legal teams,
and how often stories turned into internal playbooks. Only after trust climbed did we optimize for wider reach.

The result? Twice the publishing cadence, better reader completion, and experts excited to contribute because the
system helped them shine.

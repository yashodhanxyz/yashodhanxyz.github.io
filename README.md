# yashodhanxyz.github.io

Clean slate for the next iteration of the site. The repository currently hosts a minimal static page as a placeholder. Feel free to replace the contents with the new build when ready.

## Working locally

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the placeholder page.
2. Update or replace the HTML/CSS as you design the new site.

When you are ready to publish, push the changes to the `main` branch so GitHub Pages serves the updated content.
